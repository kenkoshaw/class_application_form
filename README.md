# class_application_form

This was the first webpage I developed. A application form for 'Programming Kids' teaching course I helped with during my internship at No 1 Solutions in Tokyo. This project took me 2 weeks, 1 week to learn HTML, CSS and basics of PHP, and 1 week to make the webpage. This application form consists of three webpages, the 'form' page, a 'confirmation' page and a 'completion' page.

I really enjoyed doing this project as there was always more i could add to improve it. For example, improving the security by having protocols against SQL injections and other types of input security risks. I was able to learn alot from this project, I didnt have much GUI experience before this so it was very intriguing to learn html and css for the first time. Learning php was also helpful as it gave me more insight into web development.
